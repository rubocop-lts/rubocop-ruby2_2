# Rubocop::Ruby22

See the intro [blog post](https://dev.to/pboling/rubocop-ruby-matrix-gems-nj)!

This gem requires no other gems. It depends on `rubocop`, but does not `require 'rubocop'`.

Awareness of `rubocop`'s lack of [SemVer][semver] adherence isn't evenly dispersed in the Ruby community.

The Rubocop team [has real reasons](https://github.com/semver/semver/issues/317)
for [not following SemVer](https://github.com/rubocop/rubocop/issues/4243), but if you've
found this project their reasons likely weigh less, in your context (e.g. running `rubocop` from command line), than
what brought you here.

    </a>
</p>

The purpose of this gem is to constrain the `rubocop` dependency of a project in
a [SemVer compliant](https://semver.org/) (Semantic Versioning) way that aligns with the the desired minimum
compatible/supported Ruby version.

## Ruby Version Support Matrix

Adding this gem will facilitate the best practice of adding a `~> ` version constrained `rubocop` dependency, while
minimizing the risk of a rubocop minor / patch upgrade breaking the build. See the
official [compatibility matrix][rubocop-matrix] for `rubocop`.

`rubocop-ruby2_2` (this gem) will install on any version of Ruby >= 2.2, and can be used to analyze code intended to support Ruby >= 2.2.

* 🧊 - Install on Ruby `<version>`
* 🏃‍ - Will Execute on Ruby `<version>`
* 🪷 - Will not execute correctly on Ruby `<version>`
* 🛠 - Lint code with Ruby `<version>` syntax as the target

## 🗿 Stable

All releases of this gem are stable releases. The first version is `1.0.0`.

## ✨ Installation

Without bundler execute:

    $ gem install 

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'rubocop-ruby2_2', '~> 1.0', require: false
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install rubocop-ruby2_2

## 🔧 Usage

The following is optional.  We'll discuss why you might want to do this after you see what it does.

Add to the top of your project's `.rubocop.yml` configuration file:

```yaml
inherit_gem:
  rubocop-ruby2_2: rubocop.yml
```

This has the same effect as you declaring the following in your `.rubocop.yml`:

```yaml
AllCops:
  # remove if already present in your `.rubocop.yml` to gain the full benefit of this gem!
  TargetRubyVersion: 2.2
  # The sibling gems for newer versions of Ruby support the NewCops directive as soon as RuboCop adds it.
  # NewCops: enable

# Removed as of 0.80.0
# braces setting is for compatibility with Ruby 2.7+
# See:
#  * https://github.com/rubocop/rubocop/issues/7641
#  * https://github.com/rubocop/rubocop/pull/7643
Style/BracesAroundHashParameters:
  Enabled: true
  EnforcedStyle: context_dependent
```

Let's talk about these settings.

### TargetRubyVersion

Allowing this gem to manage the target ruby version means you can switch to a different gem within the family when you upgrade to the next version of Ruby, and have nothing else to change.  A single line in the `Gemfile`, and you are done.

### NewCops: enable

Commented out!  Setting does not exist in very old versions of rubocop that works with Ruby < 2.4.

If you want to use this you'll have to upgrade to Ruby >= 2.4 and use the appropriate sibling gem, e.g. [`rubocop-ruby2_4`][2-4].

[2-4]: https://github.com/rubocop-lts/rubocop-ruby2_4

### Style/BracesAroundHashParameters

In an effort to help users of this gem prepare their code for more modern Rubies it has been enabled and configured with `coontext_dependent` as the closest parallel to what will work with Ruby 2.7+, and also retain compatibility with old Ruby.

See:
* https://github.com/rubocop/rubocop/issues/7641
* https://github.com/rubocop/rubocop/pull/7643

NOTE: This cop was removed from RuboCop as of 0.80.0, so if you are on modern RuboCop and reading this for some reason, you can't use it.

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and the created tag, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).

## 🤝 Code of Conduct

Everyone interacting in the Rubocop::Ruby22 project's codebases, issue trackers, chat rooms and mailing lists is expected to follow the [code of conduct](https://github.com/rubocop-lts/rubocop-ruby2_2/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## 📌 Versioning

This library aims to adhere to [Semantic Versioning 2.0.0][semver]. Violations of this scheme should be reported as
bugs. Specifically, if a minor or patch version is released that breaks backward compatibility, a new version should be
immediately released that restores compatibility. Breaking changes to the public API will only be introduced with new
major versions.

As a result of this policy, you can (and should) specify a dependency on this gem using
the [Pessimistic Version Constraint][pvc] with two digits of precision.

For example:

```ruby
spec.add_dependency "rubocop-ruby2_2", "~> 1.0"
```
